# Python Final Project

## Overview

This project is a **data analysis project using Python** developed in a Jupyter Notebook.
The main objective is to load a dataset, clean and preprocess the data, perform statistical analysis, apply grouping and aggregation, and finally visualize insights using graphs.

The project follows a **step-by-step data analysis workflow**, making it easy to understand for beginners.

---

## Project Objectives

* Load and explore a dataset
* Clean and preprocess raw data
* Perform statistical calculations
* Apply grouping and aggregation techniques
* Select and manipulate columns efficiently
* Visualize data for better insights

---

## Tools and Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Libraries:

  * pandas
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * seaborn

---

## Step-by-Step Explanation

### 1. Importing Required Libraries

All necessary Python libraries are imported at the beginning of the notebook.
These libraries are used for:

* Data manipulation
* Numerical operations
* Data visualization

---

### 2. Loading Dataset

The dataset is loaded using pandas.
After loading:

* The first few rows are displayed
* Basic information about the dataset is checked
* Columns and data types are reviewed

---

### 3. Data Preprocessing

In this step:

* Data is prepared for analysis
* Column names are reviewed
* Incorrect or inconsistent formats are identified
* Necessary transformations are applied

---

### 4. Data Cleaning Operations

This step focuses on improving data quality:

* Handling missing values
* Removing duplicates
* Correcting invalid or inconsistent data
* Ensuring data accuracy for analysis

---

### 5. Statistical Operations

Basic statistical calculations are performed, such as:

* Mean
* Median
* Minimum and maximum values
* Count and summary statistics

These operations help understand the overall distribution of data.

---

### 6. Grouping and Aggregation Operations

Data is grouped based on specific columns to:

* Compare categories
* Perform aggregated calculations like sum, average, and count
* Extract meaningful patterns from grouped data

---

### 7. Data Selection & Column Operations

In this step:

* Specific columns are selected for analysis
* New columns are created if required
* Existing columns are modified or filtered

This helps focus on relevant data only.

---

### 8. Data Visualization

Graphs and charts are created to represent insights visually:

* Bar charts
* Line plots
* Other suitable visualizations

Visualization makes it easier to understand trends and patterns in the data.

## How to Run the Project

1. Install Python (if not already installed)
2. Install required libraries:

   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:

   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open `final_project.ipynb`
5. Run all cells in sequence

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete **data analysis workflow using Python**.
It is suitable for:

* Beginners learning data analysis
* Students working on academic projects
* Anyone who wants hands-on practice with pandas and visualization
