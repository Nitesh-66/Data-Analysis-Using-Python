# Python Final Project – Data Analysis

## Overview
This project is a Python-based **data analysis notebook** developed using **Jupyter Notebook**.  
It covers the complete data analysis process starting from data loading to cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

The project is designed to demonstrate practical knowledge of Python data analysis tools and techniques in a clear and well-structured manner.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **NumPy** – numerical computations
- **Pandas** – data handling and analysis
- **Matplotlib** – basic data visualization
- **Seaborn** – advanced and attractive visualizations

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading
- Dataset is loaded using Pandas
- Initial inspection of rows, columns, and data types

### 2. Data Understanding
- Viewing dataset information
- Summary statistics for better understanding

### 3. Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicate records
- Correcting data formats when required

### 4. Data Analysis
- Performing statistical operations
- Filtering and selecting data
- Column-wise computations

### 5. Grouping & Aggregation
- Grouping data using `groupby()`
- Applying aggregation functions such as sum, count, and average

### 6. Data Visualization
- Bar charts
- Line graphs
- Histograms
- Visual representation of insights
